                   <p style="color:Darkgreen"><b>Personal Testimony:</b> The Golden Compass is my favorite book because I spent a lot of time reading it as a young child
                     and really enjoyed the book's characters. The twists and turns along the story made me excited to continue reading the book.
                     Additionally, I enjoyed the happy ending of the story. </p>
